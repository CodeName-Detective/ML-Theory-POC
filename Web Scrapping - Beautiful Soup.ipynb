According to the plan, family/dependents of the life insured is/are eligible for a lump sum amount in case of death or critical illness (if applied for) of the life insured during the tenure of the policy. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at the salient features of the term insurance plans.</p>\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Claim Settlement Ratio:</strong> The claim settlement ratio can be described as the percentage of claim settled by the insurance company as compared to the total number of claims received.<br /><strong>**Claim settlement ratio = (No.of claim settled / No.of claim received) *100</strong><br /><br />With the help of the claim settlement ratio of the company, the policy buyers can get a clear idea of the ratio of claim settled by the insurance company in a financial year. The insurance companies, which have a higher claim settlement ratio are considered more reliable and a better choice of investment.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Death Benefits :\\xc2\\xa0</strong>On the demise of the life assured during the tenure of the policy, the nominee/ beneficiary of the policy receives the total death benefit chosen at the time of commencement<strong>.\\xc2\\xa0</strong>Depending on the type of term insurance plan, the death benefit may stay the same over the whole tenure of the plan (standard term plans), decrease (decreasing term plans) or increase (increasing term plans). The insurers provide various options of payment for the term insurance plan. These include a lump sum payment, lump-sum payment plus an annuity that may be monthly, quarterly or yearly, or simply annuities that are spread over the agreed number of years.<br /><br />Moreover, there are basic life cover plus monthly income term insurance plans which are specifically designed to take care of the monthly expenses of the family, even in the absence of the life insured. Under term insurance plan\\xc2\\xa0option, a lump-sum payout is made to the beneficiary in case of demise of the life insured. Along with the one-time payment, the term plan also offers monthly payouts for the fixed tenure of 10 years, in order to meet the daily expenses of the family.<br /><br />This term insurance plan is best suitable for individuals who are the single breadwinner of the family or whose dependents do not have any other source of income. So, with the monthly income feature of the plan, the dependents can use the money wisely and take care of their monthly liabilities.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Limited Pay:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>Limited premium payment term insurance plan allows the policyholder to pay the premiums for the limited-term period, while the coverage continues for the longer tenure. For example, if an individual buys a term plan with policy coverage of 25 years and premium payment tenure of 10 years, then he/she will have to pay the premium only for the term period of 10 years whereas, the coverage will continue for the tenure of 25 years. \\xc2\\xa0There are many different benefits of limited pay option such as:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The premium payment term ends within a short- time period.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The limited pay plans offer a longer duration of life coverage.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reduce the chances of policy lapse.<br />Besides this, one of the major benefits offered by limited pay option is that, under this option of premium payment, one can save up to 40% on the term insurance premium amount.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p><strong>For Example- Let us assume.</strong></p>\\r\\n<div class=\"footable\">\\r\\n<table width=\"647\">\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Payment Type</strong></td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Monthly Premium</strong></td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Payment Term</strong></td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Total Premium</strong></td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Regular Pay</strong></td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">Rs.944</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">44 years X 12</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">Rs.4. 98 lakh</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Limited Pay</strong></td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">Rs.2.34 K</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">10 years X 12</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">Rs.2.81 Lakh</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"324\">\\xc2\\xa0</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Savings</strong></td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">Rs.2.17 lakh</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\"><strong>Effective Savings</strong></td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"162\">44%</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n</tbody>\\r\\n</table>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Policy Term:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>The minimum policy term is 5 years, with the maximum varying from 25 years to whole life span for equated monthly premium payments. For single premium policies, the policy term can vary from a minimum of 5 years to a maximum of 40 years. People can opt for the term plan period they think works for them. Experts suggests to go for term insurance plan which has a longer term-period as the premium amount generally gets locked and the insured party gets to pay the same premium over the tenure of the term plan for the same amount of cover.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Entry Age:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>To be eligible for term insurance plans, the minimum age of entry is 18 years, with a maximum age limit of 65 years with optional add on benefits. The premium of the term plan increases with age and people who are looking for a term policy for a longer period should opt for the best term insurance policy when they are relatively young.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Maturity Age:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>The best term insurance plans are those that offer cover well into the lifetime of the insured. Most term plans offer coverage to the insured up to 65-70 years of age. Term plans that have a higher maturity age may also charge a higher premium rate as they offer a term insurance cover against life risks for a longer tenure. Also, the risks increase with age and this is reflected in the premium amount.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tax Benefits:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>Term insurance plans\\xc2\\xa0come with excellent tax benefits. You can avail lucrative tax benefits under Section 80C and Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Additionally, the premiums paid for the Critical Illness Benefit towards tern plan, also qualifies for a deduction under Section 80D.<br /><strong><em><br />Note:</em></strong><em> Tax benefits are subject to changes in tax laws. Please consult your tax advisor for details.</em></li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Maturity Benefits:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>Term insurance plans don\\'t come with any survival or maturity benefits. If one wants maturity benefits, then a TROP (Term Return of Premium) plan is suggested.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Plan Choice:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>Term insurance provides flexibility in terms of choosing the plan on a single life basis or joint life basis. Single life means that the term plan will only provide cover for the life of the insured party who is generally the breadwinner of the family. A joint life term plan, on the other hand, covers the life of both the husband and the wife through a single term plan. Most term insurance plans offer the term plan on a first claim basis. This means that the term plan pays the sum insured on the expiry of either of the two insured people. There are also other term plans that pay on the death of both the insured persons.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Survival Benefits:\\xc2\\xa0</strong>A standard term plan does not have any survival benefits. However, the demand from investors has meant that various companies have opted to launch term insurance plans with survival benefits. Called Term Return of Premium (TROP) plans, the term plan refunds the premium at the end of the term plan tenure if the insured person survives the period. The TROP plan is becoming popular with people who are looking for savings as well as insurance with their term plan.<br /><br />This term insurance plan has a higher premium than the standard term plan but has the advantage of assurance that the policyholder will get back the premium he or she paid to the life insurance company for the cover. Policy holder should read the insurance terms and conditions carefully to ensure they know the amount of money they will get back as survival benefits.

The benefits can be added to the term plan by paying an additional premium amount. The best term plan in India is the one that offers these riders at a comparatively lower price than opting for such cover through individual plans.

All of these companies offer both types of online and offline term life insurance with each term policy having its own set of specific features that make it the <a href=\"https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/term-insurance/articles/best-term-insurance-plans-in-india/\">best term insurance plan</a>\\xc2\\xa0in the market. To understand these plans we need to look at them a bit more in depth.</p>\\r\\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Standard Term Insurance\\xc2\\xa0Plans</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A standard term\\xc2\\xa0insurance plan is one where the insured person gets a cover against various risks against payment of a certain premium amount. The most common term plan and generally also considered the best term insurance policy is the one that charges a yearly premium for an annual cover.</p>\\r\\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Term Return of Premium (TROP) Plans</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A term return of premium policy is a term insurance plan that refunds the premium paid for the cover in case the insured party survives the policy period. These term plans are increasingly becoming popular as the policyholder gets the money they have invested in the term insurance policy at the end of the policy period.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These term plans also give the insured the option to add on riders that they feel are essential. These riders add to the premium of such a term plan just like any other standard term\\xc2\\xa0insurance policy.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Group Term Insurance Plans</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Group term insurance are term insurance plans that are specially designed for businesses, companies, societies, associations or large families and provide term plan insurance cover for all the members of the group. These policies provide the same set of benefits that an individual term plan offers but the overall coverage is generally more in terms of illnesses or other factors that are generally excluded in the individual policies. Most of these term plans are offline as each policy is generally customised to suit the needs of the group taking the policy.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Term Insurance Plans by Number of Years</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Insurance companies also provide term insurance plans for a specific number of years. Term plans are called level term plans in industry parlance as the nominees receive the same level of death benefit if the worst comes to pass during the tenure of the term policy. However, some companies also provide decreasing term options.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The amount of premium to be paid each year in these term plans generally remains the same throughout the whole tenure of the policy. In some instances, term insurance companies may increase the premium every few years for some longer term insurance plans. These term life insurance plans can range from 5 years to 30 years . The policyholder can further renew the plan for an additional period of the same tenure, subject to him or her meeting the conditions laid down under the plan for renewing the term policy. The level term insurance plans do not generically provide a maturity benefit as the focus is to keep the premium low.</p>\\r\\n<h3>5 Year Term Insurance Plans</h3>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\">The\\xc2\\xa05-year term insurance plan comes with a minimum policy tenure of 5 years. These plans come with a lower premium and the term insurance buyers have the option to pay the premium in different modes i.e. monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.<br /> <br /> <strong>The 5 year term plan is suitable for:</strong></p>\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<li>Individuals who have short-term financial goals.</li>\\r\\n<li>People who are retired and want an additional cover for five more years.</li>\\r\\n<li>Citizens with lower premium potential.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h3>10 Year Term Insurance Plans</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A 10-year term insurance plan offers a minimum policy tenure of 10 years.<br /> <br />Similar to other term insurance plans, the premium of the policy generally remains the same throughout the period of the plan. The term plan insurance companies offer different options of premium payment i.e. single premium payment option and regular payment option, which includes annual, half-yearly, quarterly and monthly premium payment. Generally, the premium amount of single pay policy is lower as compared to the total of the premiums paid through the regular mode of premium payment.<br /><br /><strong>A 10 year term plan is ideal for:</strong></p>\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<ul class=\"data_ul\">\\r\\n<li>Long term coverage and future financial stability of the family.</li>\\r\\n<li>Planning for the retirement years till 60 years of age.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Decreasing and Increasing Term Insurance Plans</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Decreasing Term Insurance Plans</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The decreasing term insurance plans are a renewable term plan where the sum assured of the policy decreases every year by a fixed percentage over the tenure of the policy. These plans are generally offered as mortgage clearing plan. Decreasing term plans are taken to clear debts and loans. In case of demise of the insured person, the available sum assured amount is paid towards the repayment of the loan. The premium rate of decreasing term plans is less as compared to the normal term plans. This term insurance policy provides financial security to the insured\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family and offers the benefit of tax exemption at an affordable premium rate.</p>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Increasing Term Insurance Plans</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cover and the premium increase over the overall tenure of the renewable term insurance\\xc2\\xa0plan. This term plan helps to cover against risk from rising inflation costs that may affect the real value of the death benefits that the insured individual\\'s family would receive. The cover under these term plans rises at a pre-specified rate and keeps increasing until the overall value of the cover is 1.5 times the original cover under the term policy.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\r\\n<h2>Single Life and Joint Life Term Insurance Plans</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A joint term insurance plan works out to be cheaper than buying two individual term insurance plans. Moreover, the features and benefits remain the same, ensuring both the members get the same advantages of the plan.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These policies are ideal for a couple with children as it will ensure the dependents will not have to worry about their future if the unfortunate comes to pass and both parents pass away. A joint term insurance policy is the best option to go with as it also provides insurance cover for the surviving spouse.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Offline and Online Term Insurance Plans</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Offline term plans are those that are sold through traditional methods such as through an agent or a branch, while online term plans refer to term insurance plans that are sold over the internet. Term insurance providers offer an online term plan at a significantly discounted rate than the offline plan. The primary reason for this is the lack of any intermediaries such as the agent or the branch between the policyholder and the insurance company for an online term insurance plan.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">People could now buy <a href=\"https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online life insurance</a> at the click of a mouse in a few minutes.Research shows that an online term insurance plan may be cheaper by as much as 40% in some cases than the offline plan that offers the same features and benefits.

In this option, the policyholders can enhance the coverage of the policy under particular circumstances or critical situations.</li>\\r\\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Riders:</strong> While purchasing a term plan, it is important to check the rider benefits offered by the term insurance\\xc2\\xa0company in a detailed way.

By investing in plan, you will get deduction under Section 80C &amp;amp; 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1956.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additional protection options: Many term insurance plans comes with additional cover options in the form of riders such as Critical Illness, Accidental death or disability, Hospital cash etc. It is easy to appreciate the need of these benefits with our current lifestyle habits.</p>                </div>\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n        </article>\\r\\n                 <article class=\"tabberArticle fullWidth\">\\r\\n             <div class=\"pbfaqQues\" >\\r\\n                 <span class=\"que_icn\">Q:</span><p>How much risk cover should I buy?</p>\\r\\n             </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\"pbfaqAns\">\\r\\n                                <span class=\"tabAns \">Ans:</span>\\r\\n                <div class=\"ansData\">\\r\\n                    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How much risk cover you should buy primarily depends on your annual income. The general thumb rule says that risk cover should be 10 - 15 times of your annual income. It means if you are earning Rs 4 lakh/annum then you should buy a term risk cover of at least Rs 40 lakh. The idea is to arrange for self sustainability of dependents so that life style can be maintained and future needs could be settled after the demise of a policyholder.</p>\\r\\n<p>This also depends on the age. Younger age people should and can buy higher term insurance&nbsp;cover &ndash; up to 25 times. This is because their dependents will take a longer time to be on their toes.

However, surrendering a term policy is not recommended because that will cost you a lot as the entire premium paid towards current plan will lapse without any return and the new policy which you will buy come at high cost since your age has increased.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In such a case, it is advised to continue with your current term policy and buy another term insurance policy&nbsp;after declaring your current insurance plans, thus availing benefits of both the plans. For the term plans&nbsp;bought offline, one can consider closing them down after analyzing cost difference. Generally online term plans&nbsp;will be way cheaper with the age factor as well.</p>                </div>\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n        </article>\\r\\n                 <article class=\"tabberArticle fullWidth\">\\r\\n             <div class=\"pbfaqQues\" >\\r\\n                 <span class=\"que_icn\">Q:</span><p>Why term insurance premium rates for a smoker are higher than that of a non-smoker?</p>\\r\\n             </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\"pbfaqAns\">\\r\\n                                <span class=\"tabAns \">Ans:</span>\\r\\n                <div class=\"ansData\">\\r\\n                    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to current rules and regulations, insurance companies charge high premium from smokers or tobacco users than non-smokers as there is more risk involved in insuring a smoker. Also, a smoker becomes more susceptible to diseases, especially heart related disorders, and therefore, increasing the risk for the insurer. To combat high risk, insurers charge higher term insurance premium rates from smokers.

Also, late marriages and children at a high age mean responsibilities do not end at 60 years, which was earlier considered as a retirement age. Our financial experts at PolicyBazaar believe that a person needs coverage at least till 65 years, though it may vary as per circumstances. You should go for plans that offer you flexibility of fixing the tenure.

For example, instead of buying a 20/25years long plan you can buy multiple policies with different maturity dates. This will help you manage your finances better through different stages of your life. Moreover, when you have multiple policies, the rejection of claim from one insurer will not matter most as long as you have other back up policies to file your claim. On the other hand if you have only one policy and your claim gets rejected, the entire money would be lost. So it is always better to buy multiple policies instead of one.</p>                </div>\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n        </article>\\r\\n                 <article class=\"tabberArticle fullWidth\">\\r\\n             <div class=\"pbfaqQues\" >\\r\\n                 <span class=\"que_icn\">Q:</span><p>How much premium will be raised in case there are issues with my medical condition?</p>\\r\\n             </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\"pbfaqAns\">\\r\\n                                <span class=\"tabAns \">Ans:</span>\\r\\n                <div class=\"ansData\">\\r\\n                    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In case there are issues with your medical condition, your term insurance premium will increase.

       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Term Insurance Plans are specifically designed to secure your family's basic  financial needs in case of death or uncertainty. According to the plan, family/dependents of the life insured is/are eligible for a lump sum amount in case of death or critical illness (if applied for) of the life insured during the tenure of the policy. Let’s take a look at the salient features of the term insurance plans.</p>\n",

       "<ul class=\"data_ul\">\n",
       "<ul class=\"data_ul\">\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Claim Settlement Ratio:</strong> The claim settlement ratio can be described as the percentage of claim settled by the insurance company as compared to the total number of claims received.<br/><strong>**Claim settlement ratio = (No.of claim settled / No.of claim received) *100</strong><br/><br/>With the help of the claim settlement ratio of the company, the policy buyers can get a clear idea of the ratio of claim settled by the insurance company in a financial year. The insurance companies, which have a higher claim settlement ratio are considered more reliable and a better choice of investment.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Death Benefits : </strong>On the demise of the life assured during the tenure of the policy, the nominee/ beneficiary of the policy receives the total death benefit chosen at the time of commencement<strong>. </strong>Depending on the type of term insurance plan, the death benefit may stay the same over the whole tenure of the plan (standard term plans), decrease (decreasing term plans) or increase (increasing term plans). The insurers provide various options of payment for the term insurance plan. These include a lump sum payment, lump-sum payment plus an annuity that may be monthly, quarterly or yearly, or simply annuities that are spread over the agreed number of years.<br/><br/>Moreover, there are basic life cover plus monthly income term insurance plans which are specifically designed to take care of the monthly expenses of the family, even in the absence of the life insured. Under term insurance plan option, a lump-sum payout is made to the beneficiary in case of demise of the life insured. Along with the one-time payment, the term plan also offers monthly payouts for the fixed tenure of 10 years, in order to meet the daily expenses of the family.<br/><br/>This term insurance plan is best suitable for individuals who are the single breadwinner of the family or whose dependents do not have any other source of income. So, with the monthly income feature of the plan, the dependents can use the money wisely and take care of their monthly liabilities.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Limited Pay: </strong>Limited premium payment term insurance plan allows the policyholder to pay the premiums for the limited-term period, while the coverage continues for the longer tenure. For example, if an individual buys a term plan with policy coverage of 25 years and premium payment tenure of 10 years, then he/she will have to pay the premium only for the term period of 10 years whereas, the coverage will continue for the tenure of 25 years.  There are many different benefits of limited pay option such as:\n",

       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The premium payment term ends within a short- time period.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The limited pay plans offer a longer duration of life coverage.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reduce the chances of policy lapse.<br/>Besides this, one of the major benefits offered by limited pay option is that, under this option of premium payment, one can save up to 40% on the term insurance premium amount.</li>\n",

Experts suggests to go for term insurance plan which has a longer term-period as the premium amount generally gets locked and the insured party gets to pay the same premium over the tenure of the term plan for the same amount of cover.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Entry Age: </strong>To be eligible for term insurance plans, the minimum age of entry is 18 years, with a maximum age limit of 65 years with optional add on benefits. The premium of the term plan increases with age and people who are looking for a term policy for a longer period should opt for the best term insurance policy when they are relatively young.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Maturity Age: </strong>The best term insurance plans are those that offer cover well into the lifetime of the insured. Most term plans offer coverage to the insured up to 65-70 years of age. Term plans that have a higher maturity age may also charge a higher premium rate as they offer a term insurance cover against life risks for a longer tenure. Also, the risks increase with age and this is reflected in the premium amount.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tax Benefits: </strong>Term insurance plans come with excellent tax benefits. You can avail lucrative tax benefits under Section 80C and Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Additionally, the premiums paid for the Critical Illness Benefit towards tern plan, also qualifies for a deduction under Section 80D.<br/><strong><em><br/>Note:</em></strong><em> Tax benefits are subject to changes in tax laws. Please consult your tax advisor for details.</em></li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Maturity Benefits: </strong>Term insurance plans don't come with any survival or maturity benefits. If one wants maturity benefits, then a TROP (Term Return of Premium) plan is suggested.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Plan Choice: </strong>Term insurance provides flexibility in terms of choosing the plan on a single life basis or joint life basis. Single life means that the term plan will only provide cover for the life of the insured party who is generally the breadwinner of the family. A joint life term plan, on the other hand, covers the life of both the husband and the wife through a single term plan. Most term insurance plans offer the term plan on a first claim basis. This means that the term plan pays the sum insured on the expiry of either of the two insured people. There are also other term plans that pay on the death of both the insured persons.</li>\n",
       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Survival Benefits: </strong>A standard term plan does not have any survival benefits. However, the demand from investors has meant that various companies have opted to launch term insurance plans with survival benefits. Called Term Return of Premium (TROP) plans, the term plan refunds the premium at the end of the term plan tenure if the insured person survives the period. The TROP plan is becoming popular with people who are looking for savings as well as insurance with their term plan.<br/><br/>This term insurance plan has a higher premium than the standard term plan but has the advantage of assurance that the policyholder will get back the premium he or she paid to the life insurance company for the cover. Policy holder should read the insurance terms and conditions carefully to ensure they know the amount of money they will get back as survival benefits.

       "<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Additional Rider Benefits: </strong>Additional optional benefits such as critical illness and accidental death/ disability or Accelerated Sum Assured are also available under the term insurance policy. The benefits can be added to the term plan by paying an additional premium amount.

       "<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Term Return of Premium (TROP) Plans</h2>\n",
       "<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A term return of premium policy is a term insurance plan that refunds the premium paid for the cover in case the insured party survives the policy period.

       "<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These term plans also give the insured the option to add on riders that they feel are essential. These riders add to the premium of such a term plan just like any other standard term insurance policy.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Group Term Insurance Plans</h2>\n",
       "<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Group term insurance are term insurance plans that are specially designed for businesses, companies, societies, associations or large families and provide term plan insurance cover for all the members of the group. These policies provide the same set of benefits that an individual term plan offers but the overall coverage is generally more in terms of illnesses or other factors that are generally excluded in the individual policies. Most of these term plans are offline as each policy is generally customised to suit the needs of the group taking the policy.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Term Insurance Plans by Number of Years</h2>\n",
       "<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Insurance companies also provide term insurance plans for a specific number of years.

However, some companies also provide decreasing term options.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The amount of premium to be paid each year in these term plans generally remains the same throughout the whole tenure of the policy. In some instances, term insurance companies may increase the premium every few years for some longer term insurance plans. These term life insurance plans can range from 5 years to 30 years . The policyholder can further renew the plan for an additional period of the same tenure, subject to him or her meeting the conditions laid down under the plan for renewing the term policy. The level term insurance plans do not generically provide a maturity benefit as the focus is to keep the premium low.</p>\n",

       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The decreasing term insurance plans are a renewable term plan where the sum assured of the policy decreases every year by a fixed percentage over the tenure of the policy. These plans are generally offered as mortgage clearing plan. Decreasing term plans are taken to clear debts and loans. In case of demise of the insured person, the available sum assured amount is paid towards the repayment of the loan. The premium rate of decreasing term plans is less as compared to the normal term plans. This term insurance policy provides financial security to the insured’s family and offers the benefit of tax exemption at an affordable premium rate.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Offline and Online Term Insurance Plans</h2>\n",
       "<p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Offline term plans are those that are sold through traditional methods such as through an agent or a branch, while online term plans refer to term insurance plans that are sold over the internet.

In addition to this, the online term insurance plan as well bring some additional responsibility on the insured of staying focus and informed for the features of the product. It is only when one matches his/her requirements with the term plan; he/she is eligible to purchase it. Mentioned below are three steps for making the right choice while buying a term policy:</p>\n",

To find out the same, there are many term insurance calculators available online. One can use one of these calculators and find out how much he/she should invest per month so that the future requirements of his/her family are met when he/she is not around.</p>\n",
       "<p>If one wants to calculate it manually, then he/she can do the same by following the thumb rule of the term policy calculation. According to this rule, the life or term insurance coverage should be 15 times the annual salary of the policyholder. So, if Mr. A’s annual income is Rs.12 Lakh, then he requires a term insurance of Rs.1.8 Crore. However, the second step is also added in this, wherein one should also find out the required coverage from term life insurance for covering his/her other financial obligations like the higher education of policyholder’s children and other outstanding loans. For example, the sum of these financial obligations on Mr. A is Rs.50Lakh, and then the total coverage from the life or term insurance that he wants is Rs.2.3 Crore.</p>\n",

The riders are available at an additional cost, but most of the insurers make these available at affordable premiums. Therefore, it is worth to attach a suitable rider in the term insurance plan.

The longer is this tenure, the greater will be the annual premium of the term plan.

Therefore, it is essential to consider different necessary factors such as the tenure of the term insurance plan and its coverage.</p>\n",

Also, late marriages and children at a high age mean responsibilities do not end at 60 years, which was earlier considered as a retirement age. Our financial experts at PolicyBazaar believe that a person needs coverage at least till 65 years, though it may vary as per circumstances. You should go for plans that offer you flexibility of fixing the tenure. For example, a businessman might have planned for extended earning years and therefore, it makes sense to buy income replacement plan.</p> </div>\n",

Term insurance plans are the only life insurance products that are especially designed to solve a sole purpose of protection. Now that everyone knows, it covers death perils and risks; here are some other core <a href=\"https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/term-insurance/articles/term-insurance-and-its-benefits/\">benefits of term insurance</a> plans in India:</p>,\n",
       " <p>A term insurance also aids in providing safety for the dependents from your fiscal liabilities such as loans or any other debts that you have.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Together with offering life cover, a term insurance plan also offers protection against critical illness. For a tiny add-on premium amount, Critical Illness cover offers lump sum payment when any critical illness such as kidney failure, cancer, or heart attack, etc. is first detected.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Term insurance plan offers a large amount of coverage for life insurance at an economical premium. Moreover, this term plan also compensates a lump sum amount as regular source of income in case of a disability leading to loss of income.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Term insurance plans come loaded with tax benefits on the premiums paid. New-age term insurance plans along with critical illness cover also provide some additional tax benefits on the premiums paid by the policyholder. One can also avail benefits subject to the conditions u/s 10(10D) on the amount that his/her family receives in the case of an untimely demise or unfortunate event.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In some of the term plans, the insurance provider pays the future premiums in the case of permanent or total disability. Consequently, the policyholder’s life insurance cover continues even if s/he is not able to make payment of the premiums.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So as to amplify the security of the family, a term insurance plan offers add-on pay-out in the case of an accidental or untimely demise.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Term insurance offers flexible plan options to suit the need of every individual. You can choose:</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Term Insurance Plans are specifically designed to secure your family's basic  financial needs in case of death or uncertainty. According to the plan, family/dependents of the life insured is/are eligible for a lump sum amount in case of death or critical illness (if applied for) of the life insured during the tenure of the policy. Let’s take a look at the salient features of the term insurance plans.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>For Example- Let us assume.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are a number of term insurance plans available in the market from various insurance companies in India. All of these companies offer both types of online and offline term life insurance with each term policy having its own set of specific features that make it the <a href=\"https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/term-insurance/articles/best-term-insurance-plans-in-india/\">best term insurance plan</a> in the market. To understand these plans we need to look at them a bit more in depth.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A standard term insurance plan is one where the insured person gets a cover against various risks against payment of a certain premium amount. The most common term plan and generally also considered the best term insurance policy is the one that charges a yearly premium for an annual cover.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A term return of premium policy is a term insurance plan that refunds the premium paid for the cover in case the insured party survives the policy period. These term plans are increasingly becoming popular as the policyholder gets the money they have invested in the term insurance policy at the end of the policy period.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These term plans also give the insured the option to add on riders that they feel are essential. These riders add to the premium of such a term plan just like any other standard term insurance policy.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Group term insurance are term insurance plans that are specially designed for businesses, companies, societies, associations or large families and provide term plan insurance cover for all the members of the group. These policies provide the same set of benefits that an individual term plan offers but the overall coverage is generally more in terms of illnesses or other factors that are generally excluded in the individual policies. Most of these term plans are offline as each policy is generally customised to suit the needs of the group taking the policy.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Insurance companies also provide term insurance plans for a specific number of years. Term plans are called level term plans in industry parlance as the nominees receive the same level of death benefit if the worst comes to pass during the tenure of the term policy. However, some companies also provide decreasing term options.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The amount of premium to be paid each year in these term plans generally remains the same throughout the whole tenure of the policy. In some instances, term insurance companies may increase the premium every few years for some longer term insurance plans. These term life insurance plans can range from 5 years to 30 years . The policyholder can further renew the plan for an additional period of the same tenure, subject to him or her meeting the conditions laid down under the plan for renewing the term policy. The level term insurance plans do not generically provide a maturity benefit as the focus is to keep the premium low.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"paragraphBu\">The 5-year term insurance plan comes with a minimum policy tenure of 5 years. These plans come with a lower premium and the term insurance buyers have the option to pay the premium in different modes i.e. monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.<br/> <br/> <strong>The 5 year term plan is suitable for:</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A 10-year term insurance plan offers a minimum policy tenure of 10 years.<br/> <br/>Similar to other term insurance plans, the premium of the policy generally remains the same throughout the period of the plan. The term plan insurance companies offer different options of premium payment i.e. single premium payment option and regular payment option, which includes annual, half-yearly, quarterly and monthly premium payment. Generally, the premium amount of single pay policy is lower as compared to the total of the premiums paid through the regular mode of premium payment.<br/><br/><strong>A 10 year term plan is ideal for:</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The decreasing term insurance plans are a renewable term plan where the sum assured of the policy decreases every year by a fixed percentage over the tenure of the policy. These plans are generally offered as mortgage clearing plan. Decreasing term plans are taken to clear debts and loans.

       " <p>Riders are the add-on coverage which can be purchased by the policyholder along with the basic term plans in order to enhance the coverage of the policy. There are various online term insurance plans which offer rider as an in-built feature of the policy. Before, zeroing in on an online term plan it is very important to check what are the in-built riders and add-on riders offered under term insurance policy. The rider benefit can be availed by paying an extra premium to the insurer along with the basic premium of the policy. Some of the riders offered by the term plans are:</p>,\n",
       " <p>With this term insurance rider benefit, the insurance holder receives a lump-sum amount in case of valid diagnosis of any critical illnesses as pre-specified in the policy. The illnesses which are covered under critical illness cover are heart attack, cancer, paralysis, stroke, kidney failure, coronary artery bypass surgery, major organ transplant, etc.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This is one of the most beneficial rider benefit offered under term insurance policy.  Under this rider benefit, in case the life insured fails to pay the future premium of the policy due to a disability or income loss, then all the future premiums of the term plan are waived off and the policy continues to remain active.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Accidental death benefit rider can be bought in order to enhance the coverage of the term insurance policy. Under this rider benefit, an extra sum assured amount is paid to the beneficiary of the policy along with the basic sum assured amount in case of accidental demise of the insured person.  This rider benefit works as a saviour by offering an add-on payment to the family at the time of financial hardship.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This is an add-on rider benefit offered by the term insurance wherein, an extra sum assured amount is paid to the policyholder in case; he/she suffers from an accidental permanent or partial disability which leads to unemployment. Generally, the insurance companies offer 10% or more sum assured amount per year in order to compensate for the regular income that may happen due to total and permanent disability of the policyholder.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This rider offered by term plan is specifically designed to generate income after the demise of the life insured. Under this rider benefit, the insured’s family receives additional income every year for the tenure of 5-10 years, along with the regular sum assured amount.</p>,\n",
       " <p>There are various factors which determine how much term insurance coverage one should take. For the convenience of the insurance buyers, here we have discussed some of the factors.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The term offered by most of the term insurance plans ranges between 5 to 40 years. One must opt for the term of a policy according to his/her retirement age. Indians generally retire at the age of 60 years. In this way, if a person purchases a term insurance plan at the age of 60 years, then by that age most of his/her liabilities and responsibilities are cleared. However, a policyholder can opt for the life cover till the age of 99 years, if he/she has several dependents and wants to provide financial coverage to them for their entire life span.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The best thing about the online term plan is that the freedom of the policyholder to select the most suitable policy. In addition to this, the online term insurance plan as well bring some additional responsibility on the insured of staying focus and informed for the features of the product. It is only when one matches his/her requirements with the term plan; he/she is eligible to purchase it. Mentioned below are three steps for making the right choice while buying a term policy:</p>,\n",
       " <p>The first step that every term life insurance buyer should consider while purchasing it to find out the amount of coverage as per the requirements of his/her family’s future needs. To find out the same, there are many term insurance calculators available online. One can use one of these calculators and find out how much he/she should invest per month so that the future requirements of his/her family are met when he/she is not around.</p>,\n",
       " <p>If one wants to calculate it manually, then he/she can do the same by following the thumb rule of the term policy calculation. According to this rule, the life or term insurance coverage should be 15 times the annual salary of the policyholder. So, if Mr. A’s annual income is Rs.12 Lakh, then he requires a term insurance of Rs.1.8 Crore. However, the second step is also added in this, wherein one should also find out the required coverage from term life insurance for covering his/her other financial obligations like the higher education of policyholder’s children and other outstanding loans. For example, the sum of these financial obligations on Mr. A is Rs.50Lakh, and then the total coverage from the life or term insurance that he wants is Rs.2.3 Crore.</p>,\n",
       " <p>A term insurance aspirant as well is suggested to compare term insurance plans through online term insurance comparing websites. One should compare different term insurance plans on various features such as duration of the term, maximum coverage provided, etc. It is also suggested to search for the background of the term insurance provider like the claim settlement ratio of the company, the company’s existence in the insurance industry, etc.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Term insurance plans are the purest form of life insurance. Term insurance premiums are lower than other life insurance plans. However, in order to ensure the right plan, one should go for term insurance comparison. Compare term insurance with other insurance plans online and stay covered.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Term plans as well allow purchasing riders for widening the risk coverage for the family of the policyholder. For example, to provide coverage against critical illnesses or accidents, there are riders provided by most of the term insurance providers. One can check for an appropriate rider on an online term insurance provider’s website. The riders are available at an additional cost, but most of the insurers make these available at affordable premiums. Therefore, it is worth to attach a suitable rider in the term insurance plan. In this way, the policyholder will have better risk coverage and he/she can give better protection to his/her family.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Purchasing an online term plan provides its policyholder with a lot of coverage. However, it is the responsibility of the insured to select the most affordable and suitable term insurance plan without missing out on any required detail. This is because a term plan secures the future of the family of the insured.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The tenure of the term policy is an important aspect. This is because it involves the premium amount that one pays for his/her term insurance policy. The longer is this tenure, the greater will be the annual premium of the term plan. However, if one keeps this period very short, then there are chances of being without cover at the time when the family of the policyholder is at utmost need. Therefore, it is essential to consider different necessary factors such as the tenure of the term insurance plan and its coverage.</p>,\n",

According to the plan, family/dependents of the life insured is/are eligible for a lump sum amount in case of death or critical illness (if applied for) of the life insured during the tenure of the policy. Let’s take a look at the salient features of the term insurance plans.For Example- Let us assume.There are a number of term insurance plans available in the market from various insurance companies in India. All of these companies offer both types of online and offline term life insurance with each term policy having its own set of specific features that make it the best term insurance plan\\xa0in the market. To understand these plans we need to look at them a bit more in depth.A standard term\\xa0insurance plan is one where the insured person gets a cover against various risks against payment of a certain premium amount. The most common term plan and generally also considered the best term insurance policy is the one that charges a yearly premium for an annual cover.A term return of premium policy is a term insurance plan that refunds the premium paid for the cover in case the insured party survives the policy period. These term plans are increasingly becoming popular as the policyholder gets the money they have invested in the term insurance policy at the end of the policy period.These term plans also give the insured the option to add on riders that they feel are essential. These riders add to the premium of such a term plan just like any other standard term\\xa0insurance policy.Group term insurance are term insurance plans that are specially designed for businesses, companies, societies, associations or large families and provide term plan insurance cover for all the members of the group. These policies provide the same set of benefits that an individual term plan offers but the overall coverage is generally more in terms of illnesses or other factors that are generally excluded in the individual policies. Most of these term plans are offline as each policy is generally customised to suit the needs of the group taking the policy.Insurance companies also provide term insurance plans for a specific number of years. Term plans are called level term plans in industry parlance as the nominees receive the same level of death benefit if the worst comes to pass during the tenure of the term policy. However, some companies also provide decreasing term options.The amount of premium to be paid each year in these term plans generally remains the same throughout the whole tenure of the policy. In some instances, term insurance companies may increase the premium every few years for some longer term insurance plans. These term life insurance plans can range from 5 years to 30 years . The policyholder can further renew the plan for an additional period of the same tenure, subject to him or her meeting the conditions laid down under the plan for renewing the term policy. The level term insurance plans do not generically provide a maturity benefit as the focus is to keep the premium low.The\\xa05-year term insurance plan comes with a minimum policy tenure of 5 years. These plans come with a lower premium and the term insurance buyers have the option to pay the premium in different modes i.e. monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.  The 5 year term plan is suitable for:A 10-year term insurance plan offers a minimum policy tenure of 10 years. Similar to other term insurance plans, the premium of the policy generally remains the same throughout the period of the plan. The term plan insurance companies offer different options of premium payment i.e. single premium payment option and regular payment option, which includes annual, half-yearly, quarterly and monthly premium payment. Generally, the premium amount of single pay policy is lower as compared to the total of the premiums paid through the regular mode of premium payment.A 10 year term plan is ideal for:The decreasing term insurance plans are a renewable term plan where the sum assured of the policy decreases every year by a fixed percentage over the tenure of the policy. These plans are generally offered as mortgage clearing plan. Decreasing term plans are taken to clear debts and loans. In case of demise of the insured person, the available sum assured amount is paid towards the repayment of the loan. The premium rate of decreasing term plans is less as compared to the normal term plans. This term insurance policy provides financial security to the insured’s family and offers the benefit of tax exemption at an affordable premium rate.The cover and the premium increase over the overall tenure of the renewable term insurance\\xa0plan. This term plan helps to cover against risk from rising inflation costs that may affect the real value of the death benefits that the insured individual's family would receive. The cover under these term plans rises at a pre-specified rate and keeps increasing until the overall value of the cover is 1.5 times the original cover under the term policy.\\xa0A joint term insurance plan works out to be cheaper than buying two individual term insurance plans. Moreover, the features and benefits remain the same, ensuring both the members get the same advantages of the plan.These policies are ideal for a couple with children as it will ensure the dependents will not have to worry about their future if the unfortunate comes to pass and both parents pass away. A joint term insurance policy is the best option to go with as it also provides insurance cover for the surviving spouse.Offline term plans are those that are sold through traditional methods such as through an agent or a branch, while online term plans refer to term insurance plans that are sold over the internet. Term insurance providers offer an online term plan at a significantly discounted rate than the offline plan. The primary reason for this is the lack of any intermediaries such as the agent or the branch between the policyholder and the insurance company for an online term insurance plan.People could now buy online life insurance at the click of a mouse in a few minutes.Research shows that an online term insurance plan may be cheaper by as much as 40% in some cases than the offline plan that offers the same features and benefits.

As the purest insurance product, only death benefit is offered by the term plan. Under the online term insurance plan, the insurance company gets into an agreement with the insurance buyers.According to this agreement, a lump-sum, sum assured amount is paid to the beneficiary of the term insurance\\xa0policy as a death benefit in case of the unfortunate demise of the policyholder during the policy tenure. The insurer pays the sum assured amount to the beneficiary as mentioned in the term insurance\\xa0policy documents.The sum assured amount is paid on the basis of the type of payout option chosen by the insured at the time of policy purchase. The payouts can be made as a lump-sum payment at one go or as monthly income at specific intervals of time.1. Lump-sumThe entire sum assured amount is paid at one go to the beneficiary of the term insurance policy.For example-Sum assured= 1 crorePayout= Rs.1 crore as a lump-sum payment to the beneficiary of the term insurance policy.2. Lump-sum + Monthly Income Half of the sum assured amount is paid as a lump-sum payment to the beneficiary of the term insurance policy, whereas, the other half of the sum assured amount is paid as monthly income to the beneficiary of the policy.For example-Sum assured= Rs.1crorePayout=\\xa0 Rs.50 lakh as a lump-sum payment at the time the claim is made by the nominee and Rs.50,000 every month as a death benefit.3. Income Replacement or Monthly IncomeA fixed percentage of sum assured amount is paid as monthly income from the first month of life insured’s\\xa0death.For example-Sum assured= Rs.1 CrorePayout= Rs. 1 lakh per month (Rs. 12 lakh yearly) for 83 months approximately.A term plan from Policybazaar helps you in the following way:The steps to process a claim for a term insurance plan is mentioned below:Remember: A claim is formally registered and accepted only after receiving a written request for claim settlement with a duly signed and filled claim settlement form with other relevant documents. An individual should file a term claim via phone call or by visiting the nearest branch of the insurance company for the quick claim process.As soon as the insurance provider verifies all the required documents and then accepts the claim, the payouts will be made according to the payment options present in the term plan. The payouts are usually given via ECS, for which, the nominee should submit the details of the bank, photocopy of the passbook of bank account, and canceled cheque. Some insurance providers may need these details attested by the concerned bank, so do check the same.Before purchasing any term plan, it is very important for policy buyers to go through the terms and conditions of the policy and check all the exclusions mentioned in the policy documents. \\xa0However, term insurance plans come with only one exclusion i.e.In case, the life insured (sane or insane) commits suicide within 12 months (1 years) from the date of policy inception or from date of revival of policy, the policy terminates immediately. In such cases, the beneficiary of the term insurance policy\\xa0receives only the total premium amount paid by the insured from the insurance company (inclusive of extra premium, if any, but exclusive of applicable charges and taxes imposed by the government).Apart from the above, there are other exclusions as well, which come under critical illness rider. If any of these exclusions are found at the underwriting stage of the term insurance policy, then no benefit will be offered. Let’s take a look at the exclusions, which comes under critical illness rider. \\xa0Riders are the add-on coverage which can be purchased by the policyholder along with the basic term plans in order to enhance the coverage of the policy. There are various online term insurance plans which offer rider as an in-built feature of the policy. Before, zeroing in on an online term plan it is very important to check what are the in-built riders and add-on riders offered under\\xa0term insurance policy. The rider benefit can be availed by paying an extra premium to the insurer along with the basic premium of the policy. Some of the riders offered by the term plans are:With this term insurance rider benefit, the insurance holder receives a lump-sum amount in case of valid diagnosis of any critical illnesses as pre-specified in the policy. The illnesses which are covered under critical illness cover are heart attack, cancer, paralysis, stroke, kidney failure, coronary artery bypass surgery, major organ transplant, etc.This is one of the most beneficial rider benefit offered under\\xa0term insurance policy.\\xa0 Under this rider benefit, in case the life insured fails to pay the future premium of the policy due to a disability or income loss, then all the future premiums of the term plan are waived off and the policy continues to remain active.Accidental death benefit rider can be bought in order to enhance the coverage of the term insurance policy. Under this rider benefit, an extra sum assured amount is paid to the beneficiary of the policy along with the basic sum assured amount in case of accidental demise of the insured person.\\xa0 This rider benefit works as a saviour by offering an add-on payment to the family at the time of financial hardship.This is an add-on rider benefit offered by the\\xa0term insurance\\xa0wherein, an extra sum assured amount is paid to the policyholder in case; he/she suffers from an accidental permanent or partial disability which leads to unemployment. Generally, the insurance companies offer 10% or more sum assured amount per year in order to compensate for the regular income that may happen due to total and permanent disability of the policyholder.This rider offered by term plan is specifically designed to generate income after the demise of the life insured. Under this rider benefit, the insured’s family receives additional income every year for the tenure of 5-10 years, along with the regular sum assured amount.There are various factors which determine how much term insurance\\xa0coverage one should take. For the convenience of the insurance buyers, here we have discussed some of the factors.The term offered by most of the term insurance plans ranges between 5 to 40 years. One must opt for the term of a policy according to his/her retirement age. Indians generally retire at the age of 60 years. In this way, if a person purchases a term insurance plan at the age of 60 years, then by that age most of his/her liabilities and responsibilities are cleared. However, a policyholder can opt for the life cover till the age of 99 years, if he/she has several dependents and wants to provide financial coverage to them for their entire life span.The best thing about the online term plan is that the freedom of the policyholder to select the most suitable policy. In addition to this, the online term insurance plan as well bring some additional responsibility on the insured of staying focus and informed for the features of the product. It is only when one matches his/her requirements with the term plan; he/she is eligible to purchase it. Mentioned below are three steps for making the right choice while buying a term policy:The first step that every term life insurance buyer should consider while purchasing it to find out the amount of coverage as per the requirements of his/her family’s future needs. To find out the same, there are many term insurance calculators available online. One can use one of these calculators and find out how much he/she should invest per month so that the future requirements of his/her family are met when he/she is not around.If one wants to calculate it manually, then he/she can do the same by following the thumb rule of the term policy calculation. According to this rule, the life or term insurance coverage should be 15 times the annual salary of the policyholder. So, if Mr. A’s annual income is Rs.12 Lakh, then he requires a term insurance of Rs.1.8 Crore. However, the second step is also added in this, wherein one should also find out the required coverage from term life insurance for covering his/her other financial obligations like the higher education of policyholder’s children and other outstanding loans. For example, the sum of these financial obligations on Mr. A is Rs.50Lakh, and then the total coverage from the life or term insurance that he wants is Rs.2.3 Crore.A term insurance aspirant as well is suggested to compare term insurance plans through online term insurance comparing websites. One should compare different term insurance plans on various features such as duration of the term, maximum coverage provided, etc. It is also suggested to search for the background of the term insurance provider like the claim settlement ratio of the company, the company’s existence in the insurance industry, etc.Term insurance plans are the purest form of life insurance. Term insurance premiums are lower than other life insurance plans. However, in order to ensure the right plan, one should go for term insurance comparison. Compare term insurance with other insurance plans online and stay covered.Term plans as well allow purchasing riders for widening the risk coverage for the family of the policyholder. For example, to provide coverage against critical illnesses or accidents, there are riders provided by most of the term insurance providers. One can check for an appropriate rider on an online term insurance provider’s website. The riders are available at an additional cost, but most of the insurers make these available at affordable premiums. Therefore, it is worth to attach a suitable rider in the term insurance plan. In this way, the policyholder will have better risk coverage and he/she can give better protection to his/her family.Purchasing an online term plan provides its policyholder with a lot of coverage. However, it is the responsibility of the insured to select the most affordable and suitable term insurance plan without missing out on any required detail. This is because a term plan secures the future of the family of the insured.The tenure of the term policy is an important aspect. This is because it involves the premium amount that one pays for his/her term insurance policy. The longer is this tenure, the greater will be the annual premium of the term plan. However, if one keeps this period very short, then there are chances of being without cover at the time when the family of the policyholder is at utmost need. Therefore, it is essential to consider different necessary factors such as the tenure of the term insurance plan and its coverage.Related TermsTerm insurance is the simplest form of life insurance product, which financially safeguards the future of the family and takes care of the liabilities in case of an eventuality.\\xa0Read MoreThe death benefit is the total sum assured amount paid to the beneficiary of the policy in case of the unfortunate demise of the insured person.\\xa0Read MoreTerm insurance riders are add-on benefits offered under the policy, in order to enhance the coverage of the policy.Policyholder can add riders to the plan by paying an extra premium along with the basic premium of the policy.
